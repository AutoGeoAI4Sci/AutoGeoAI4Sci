# AutoGeoAI4Sci

**AutoGeoAI4Sci** is the central hub repository of the **AutonomousGeoAI4Science** organization.

This repository serves as a **navigational and organizational entry point** to a growing ecosystem of open-source resources focused on the intersection of **artificial intelligence, geospatial science, and scientific discovery**. Our mission is to advance **Autonomous GeoAI**—AI systems that can perceive, reason, and act in complex Earth and environmental systems with minimal human intervention.

Rather than hosting a single standalone project, this hub provides a **structured overview of ongoing efforts** across multiple repositories, including educational tutorials, methodological frameworks, applied research projects, curated paper collections, and reproducible scientific artifacts.

## 🌍 Research Vision

AutoGeoAI4Sci is motivated by the following research directions:

- **Autonomous GeoAI & AI4Science**  
  Building AI systems capable of end-to-end geospatial reasoning, hypothesis generation, and decision support.

- **Foundation Models for Earth & Environmental Systems**  
  Leveraging large-scale foundation models for remote sensing, GIS, climate, disasters, and spatial intelligence.

- **Multimodal & Cross-Modal Spatial Reasoning**  
  Integrating satellite imagery, street-view data, maps, text, and temporal signals for holistic Earth understanding.

- **Reproducible & Responsible GeoAI**  
  Promoting open science, reproducibility, interpretability, and responsible deployment of GeoAI systems.

## 📂 Repository Ecosystem

The organization is structured around the following core repositories:

- **[`papers`](https://github.com/AutoGeoAI4Sci/papers)**  
  Curated research papers, benchmarks, surveys, and reproducible experiment references related to GeoAI and foundation models.

- **[`tutorials`](https://github.com/AutoGeoAI4Sci/tutorials)**  
  Hands-on tutorials for GeoAI, GIScience, spatial data science, and AI-driven geospatial workflows.

- **[`projects`](https://github.com/AutoGeoAI4Sci/projects)**  
  An index of active and past open-source research projects developed under the AutonomousGeoAI4Science initiative.

- **[`awesome-autonomous-geoai`](https://github.com/AutoGeoAI4Sci/awesome-autonomous-geoai)**  
  A curated list of resources, tools, datasets, and papers on autonomous GeoAI and AI4Science.

> **Note:** Organization-wide contribution guidelines and templates are managed centrally at the organization level.
