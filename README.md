# AutoGeoAI4Sci

**AutoGeoAI4Sci** is the central hub repository of the **AutonomousGeoAI4Science** organization.

This repository serves as a **navigational and organizational entry point** to a growing ecosystem of open-source resources focused on the intersection of **artificial intelligence, geospatial science, and scientific discovery**. Our mission is to advance **Autonomous GeoAI**—AI systems that can perceive, reason, and act in complex Earth and environmental systems with minimal human intervention.

Rather than hosting a single standalone project, this hub provides a **structured overview of ongoing efforts** across multiple repositories, including educational tutorials, methodological frameworks, applied research projects, curated paper collections, and reproducible scientific artifacts.

## 🌍 Research Vision

AutoGeoAI4Sci is motivated by the following research directions:

- **Autonomous GeoAI & AI4Science**  
  Building AI systems capable of end-to-end geospatial reasoning, hypothesis generation, and decision support.

- **Foundation Models for Earth & Environmental Systems**  
  Leveraging large-scale foundation models for remote sensing, GIS, climate, disasters, and spatial intelligence.

- **Multimodal & Cross-Modal Spatial Reasoning**  
  Integrating satellite imagery, street-view data, maps, text, and temporal signals for holistic Earth understanding.

- **Reproducible & Responsible GeoAI**  
  Promoting open science, reproducibility, interpretability, and responsible deployment of GeoAI systems.
