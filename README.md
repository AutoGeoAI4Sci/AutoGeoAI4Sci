# AutoGeoAI4Sci

**AutoGeoAI4Sci** is the central hub repository of the **AutonomousGeoAI4Science** organization.

This repository acts as a navigational and organizational entry point to a collection of tutorials, open-source projects, research papers, and reproducible resources focused on the integration of artificial intelligence and geospatial science. Our goal is to foster an open and collaborative space for researchers, students, and practitioners who are passionate about GeoAI, spatial intelligence, and AI-driven scientific discovery.

Rather than hosting a single project, this hub provides a structured overview of ongoing efforts across multiple repositories, including educational tutorials, methodological frameworks, applied research projects, and paper-related artifacts.
